1. User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.

2. Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.

3. Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.

4. Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.

5. Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.

6. Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.


Technology Stack
1. Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.

2. Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.

3. PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.

4. GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.

5. Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.

6. Redis: Used for caching and session management.

7. Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.

8. CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

Database Design Overview

1. User
Key Fields:

id: Primary key (auto-generated)

Relationships:
A Property belongs to one User (the host).
A Property can have multiple Bookings and Reviews.

3. Booking
id: Primary key
check_in: Date the guest arrives
check_out: Date the guest leaves
total_price: Total cost for the booking
status: e.g. “Pending”, “Confirmed”, “Cancelled”

Relationships:
A Booking belongs to one User (the guest).
A Booking belongs to one Property.

4. Review

rating: Numeric value (e.g. 1–5 stars)
comment: Review text
created_at: Date/time the review was made

Relationships:
A Review belongs to one User (the guest).
A Review belongs to one Property.

5. Payment
id: Primary key
amount: Total payment amount
payment_method: e.g. “Card”, “Mobile Money”
payment_date: Date payment was made
status: e.g. “Paid”, “Pending”, “Failed”

Relationships:
A Payment belongs to one Booking.
A Booking can have one Payment.

Feature Breakdown
1. User Management
This feature handles user registration, authentication, and profile management for both hosts and guests.
It ensures secure access, allowing hosts to list properties and guests to make bookings while keeping user data protected.

2. Property Management
Hosts can add, update, and manage their property listings through this feature.
It provides functionality for storing property details such as descriptions, prices, and locations — forming the foundation of the booking system.

3. Booking System
This feature allows guests to reserve available properties for specific dates and track their booking history.
It ensures that booking data such as check-in, check-out, and total cost are managed efficiently, preventing overlapping reservations.

4. Payment Processing
The payment system handles all transactions between guests and hosts.
It securely processes payments, records transaction history, and updates booking statuses based on successful or failed payments.

5. Review System
After a stay, guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
This builds trust between users, helps future guests make informed decisions, and encourages hosts to maintain quality listings.

6. Data Optimization
This feature focuses on improving database queries, caching frequently accessed data, and ensuring the application performs efficiently at scale.
It helps the system handle more users, properties, and bookings without slowing

API Security.
1. Authentication
Authentication ensures that only verified users (hosts or guests) can access protected endpoints.
The project uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or Django’s built-in Token Authentication to verify user identities.
This prevents unauthorized users from performing actions such as making bookings or viewing sensitive user information.


2. Authorization
Authorization defines what an authenticated user is allowed to do.
For example, a guest can create bookings and leave reviews, while only a host can add or manage properties.
This layer of control ensures users only interact with resources they own or are permitted to access, protecting both hosts and guests from data misuse.

3. Rate Limiting
Rate limiting helps prevent abuse of the API by restricting the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a specific time frame.
This protects the system from DDoS attacks and excessive traffic that could slow down or crash the application.

Why the Security matters
Protecting User Data: Prevents leaks of personal information like emails, payment details, and booking history.

Securing Properties: Ensures that only property owners can modify or delete their listings.

Safeguarding Payments: Prevents unauthorized access to financial transactions.

System Integrity: Keeps the API stable, reliable, and resistant to attacks or misuse

CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a development practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code. It ensures that every new code change is automatically tested and integrated into the main project, reducing human error and speeding up delivery.

IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE PROJECT.

Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically tests and validates new code when developers push changes to GitHub. This ensures that the backend APIs, models, and serializers remain functional and error-free.

Continuous Deployment (CD): Once the tests pass, the updated code can be automatically deployed to a staging or production server (like AWS, Render, or Heroku) without manual intervention.

TOOLS THAT CAN BE USED.
GitHub Actions: Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows directly from your GitHub repository.

Docker: Containers make it easy to package and deploy the Django app consistently across different environments.

Heroku : Platforms for deploying and hosting the Django application.

Pytest: Used for automated testing to ensure new changes don’t break existing features.
